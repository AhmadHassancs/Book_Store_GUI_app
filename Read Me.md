1) The .ipynb files are full explanation of the code written in .py files
2) This app is build using Python built-in Library called Tkinter. 
3) We will use pyinstaller to convert the .py file into .exe
4) To complete step 3, navigate to the directory where the .py files are stored through ANACONDA PROMP or what have you
   name_script is the name of your .py file
   and type "pyinstaller --onefile -- windowed name_script" without quotes.
5) After converting the .py file into .exe, we will have two file(.exe and .db)
6) These two files can be exported to any windows system and they will work just fine
7) In addition, when we run the .exe file it will automatically create an .db file to store all the entries.
